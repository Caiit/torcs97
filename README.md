### Computational Intelligence (UvA) course of Artificial Intelligence MSc

To implement a car that can drive autonomously, there was made use of PyTorch to implement a Neural Network, as well as Evolutionary Programming and Swarm Intelligence. The Evolutionary Algorithm was used to optimise the weights of the Neural Network and Swarm Intelligence was based on a 'winner' and a 'helper' model, where the winner would aim to win the race, while the helper would obstruct other cars to prevent them from winning.
